# ATC Radio Monitor & Transcriber - Development Summary

## Project Overview
The ATC Radio Monitor & Transcriber is a comprehensive solution for downloading, analyzing, and transcribing Air Traffic Control (ATC) radio communications. It features real-time voice activity detection, audio visualization, and automatic transcription using OpenAI's Whisper API.

## Key Features Implemented

### Core Functionality
- **ATC Stream Downloading**: Automatic downloading of live ATC radio communications from multiple towers (Boston, Osaka)
- **Voice Activity Detection**: Advanced algorithms to detect when controllers or pilots are speaking
- **Audio Archiving**: Systematic storage of audio files with timestamps and metadata
- **Spectrogram Analysis**: Visual representation of audio signals for in-depth analysis

### Transcription System
- **OpenAI Whisper Integration**: State-of-the-art speech-to-text transcription
- **Contextual Understanding**: Enhanced accuracy with aviation terminology context
- **Segmented Analysis**: Breaking down long communications into meaningful segments
- **Metadata Preservation**: Maintaining timestamps and audio references for all transcriptions

### User Interface
- **Streamlit-based Frontend**: Clean, responsive web interface for interacting with the system
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Real-time waveform displays with highlighted voice regions
- **Tabbed Navigation**: Organized access to various analysis tools and visualizations
- **Audio Playback**: In-browser playback controls for audio files

### Visualization Features
- **Dual Waveform/Energy Display**: Combined view of audio waveform and energy levels
- **Voice Activity Highlighting**: Visual indicators where voice is detected in recordings
- **Detailed Spectrograms**: Frequency analysis for advanced audio examination
- **Metadata Dashboards**: Summary statistics and file information

### Timeline Transcription Feature
- **WhatsApp-Style Chat Interface**: Intuitive message bubble layout for transcriptions
- **Speaker Identification**: Automatic classification of Tower/Controller vs. Pilot communications
- **Timestamp Integration**: Precise timing information for each communication segment
- **Synchronized Audio Playback**: Timeline-linked audio controls
- **Color-Coded Messages**: Visual differentiation between different speakers
